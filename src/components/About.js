            Let me describe a scenary to you. If you live in a part of the world
            where we measure with fractions, I bet you've run into it too.

          <p>
            You want to hang a picture in the exact middle of a wall. You break
            out your tape measure and it's 32 Â¾. You go to your calculator and
            punch in (32+3/4)/2.
          </p>

            16.375, perfect. There's only one glaring issue, there is no .375 on
            my tape measure. It's a tedious pain in the ass and I hate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freedom Calc rounds all the answers to the closest fraction. Problem
            solved. EZPZ.

            P.S. To you folks in the metric part of the world, you buncha
            commies with your socialized medicine and standardized measuring
            systems. We all know metric is a cheating. Where is the challenge?
            You rational people using science and reasoning to make your lives
            better. Despicable. /s
